First attempt at a Pyramid app for Awaken Church Charleston.

Client wanted a website that was custom looking but had scheduling and reservation functionality.

Due to the short timetable and the small budget, solution to use Eventbrite as the backend and
Pyramid as a frontend app to request data was used.  

To run see Readme in charlestonloveweek. Has since been updated to only show donation page within iFrame.

Designs conducted by Awaken Church and base styling done by HTMLBurger.  Converted to jinjga template
by @chrispotter.
