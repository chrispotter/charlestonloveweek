          Charleston LOVE WEEK is a unified effort to build on our communityâ€™s existing 
          spirit of caring, unity, compassion, selflessness, and service. Our goal is to 
          strengthen the community while creating a greater impact throughout our city. 
          Working together, we will be partnering with more than 30 organizations and over 
          3,000 community volunteers to provide upwards of 10,000 hours over the span of 1 
          week. These acts of service are designed to share hope and demonstrate love to 
          everyone we encounter. We are honored to have the opportunity to serve with you!
